    I will be joining the Medical University of Graz in 2024 as an Assistant Professor in
    Computational Microbiome Research.
- company: Institute for Systems Biology (ISB)
  location: USA
  position: Senior Research Scientist
  website: https://isbscience.org
  begin: 2018
  end: 2024
  summary: |
    I started as a Washington Research Foundation Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow
    in the Gibbons Lab. I was promoted to a Research Scientist position in 2020 and
    to a Senior Research Scientist position in 2022. My research is focused on leveraging data from
    metagenomics, deep phenotyping and wet lab experiments to unravel
    the functional consequences of compositional shifts in the mammalian gut microbiome. I also worked with
    environmental samples and long-read sequencing of metagenome samples.
    In the wet lab, I standardized and performed anaerobic *ex vivo* culturing assays and
    processed samples for shotgun sequencing, RNA-seq, proteomic, and metabolomic quantification.

  summary: |
    I held a position in Dr. Osbaldo Resendis' laboratory of Human Systems Biology.
    In the first half of my position I studied metabolic alterations in
    cancer using a variety of data sources such as metabolome, genome and
    transcriptome data and combined those with mathematical modeling
    (flux balance analysis). Later I switched my focus to the microbiome where I analyzed
    16S amplicon sequencing and metagenomic data sets from various cohorts and modeled the underlying
    microbial communities.

  summary: |
    I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Integrative Research of Biological Systems
    of Dr. Gabriel Del Rio Guerra in the field of Synthetic Biology and Peptide
    design. During my position at the UNAM I used a combination of machine learning
    and optimization theory to design multi-functional cell-penetrating and antimicrobial
    peptides and validated their function in *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiae* using
    a variety of molecular biology methods.
