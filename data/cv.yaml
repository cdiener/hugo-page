work:
- company: Institute for Systems Biology
  position: Research Scientist
  website: https://isbscience.org.org
  begin: 2020
  end: now
  summary: |
    I was promoted to a Research Scientist position in 2020. My research topics remained
    mostly the same with an additional emphasis on Metabolic Modeling of the gut
    microbiota to predict the effect of metabolic intervention.

  begin: 2018
  end: 2020
  summary: |
    Washington Research Foundation Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow
    in the Gibbons Lab. My research was focused on leveraging data from
    metagenomics, deep phenotyping and in vitro experiments in order to unravel
    the functional consequences of compositional shifts in the microbiome. I also
    worked on designing interventions in order to engineer a personalized
    microbiota that will persist wellness. Additionally, I also worked with
    environmental samples and nanopore sequencing of metagenome samples.

  summary: |
    Position in the laboratory of Human Systems Biology of Dr. Osbaldo
    Resendis. In the first half of my position I studied metabolic alterations in
    cancer using a variety of data sources such as metabolome, genome and
    transcriptome data and combining those with mathematical modeling
    (flux balance analysis). Later I switched my focus to the microbiome where I analyzed
    16S rRNA and metagenomic data sets from various cohorts and modeled the underlying
    microbial communities.

  summary: |
    PostDoc in the laboratory of Integrative Research of Biological Systems
    of Dr. Gabriel Del Rio Guerra in the field of Synthetic Biology and Peptide
    design. During my position at the UNAM I used a combination of Machine Learning
    and Optimization to design multi-functional cell-penetrating and antimicrobial
    peptides and validated their function in *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiae* using
    a variety of Molecular Biology methods.
