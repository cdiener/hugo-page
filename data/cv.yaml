  summary: Position in the laboratory of Human Systems Biology of Dr. Osbaldo
    Resendis. In the first half of my position I studied metabolic alterations in
    cancer using a variety of data sources such as metabolome, genome and
    transcriptome data and combining those with mathematical modeling
    (flux balance analysis). Later I switched my focus to the microbiome where I analyzed
    16S rRNA and metagenomic data sets from various cohorts and modeled the underlying
    microbial communities.

  summary: PostDoc in the laboratory of Integrative Research of Biological Systems
    of Dr. Gabriel Del Rio Guerra in the field of Synthetic Biology and Peptide
    design. During my position at the UNAM I used a combination of Machine Learning
    and Optimization to design multi-functional cell-penetrating and antimicrobial
    peptides and validated their function in *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiae* using
    a variety of Molecular Biology methods.
