Artificially designed small peptides are currently quite interesting for
medical research since they provide a way to target specific cellular
activities. In many cases one wants to combine several functions into a single
peptide that is as small as possible. This is problematic as the activity of the
peptide is often lost when combining several functions.  

In our article we propose a design strategy based on "compatible function",
meaning functions that require similar physio-chemical properties of the
peptide. Starting from a peptide template already containing two compatible
functions (DNA-binding and pheromone activity) we use a combination of Machine
learning and optimization to add two additional functions (cell penetration and
antibacterial) for the entire peptide by adding only a few amino acids. The
resulting peptides are all very active and provide antibacterial activity on
the level of Ampicillin with one peptide being even being much more efficient
than Ampicillin.
