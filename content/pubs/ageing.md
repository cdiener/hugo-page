title = "Gut Microbiome Pattern Reflects Healthy Aging and Predicts Extended Survival in Humans"
+++

The gut microbiome has important effects on human health, yet its importance in human
aging remains unclear. Using two independent cohorts comprising 4582 individuals across
the adult lifespan we demonstrate that, starting in mid-to-late adulthood, gut
microbiomes become increasingly unique with age. This uniqueness pattern is strongly
associated with gut microbial amino acid derivatives circulating within the bloodstream,
many of which have been previously identified as longevity biomarkers. At the latest
stages of human life, two distinct patterns emerge wherein individuals in good health
show continued microbial drift toward a unique compositional state, while the same drift
is absent in individuals who perform worse on a number of validated health measures. The
identified healthy aging pattern is characterized by an overall depletion of core genera
found across most humans - primarily a depletion in the nearly ubiquitous genus
Bacteroides. Consistently, retaining a high Bacteroides dominance into extreme age, or,
equivalently, having a low gut microbiome uniqueness score, predicts decreased survival
in a four-year follow-up. Our comprehensive analysis identifies the gut microbiome as a
novel component of healthy aging, with important implications for the worldâ€™s growing
older population.
