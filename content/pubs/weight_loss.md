+++

We report a weight-loss response analysis on a small cohort of individuals (N= 25)
selected from a larger population (N~ 5,000) enrolled in a commercial scientific
wellness program, which included healthy lifestyle coaching. Each individual had
baseline data on blood metabolomics, blood proteomics, clinical labs, lifestyle
questionnaires, and stool metagenomes. A subset of these participants (N= 15) lost at
least 10% of their body weight within a 6-12 month period and saw significant
improvement in metabolic health markers (‘weight loss’ group), while another subset of
individuals (N= 10) undergoing the same lifestyle intervention showed no change in BMI
over the same timeframe (‘no weight loss’ group). Only a single baseline blood analyte,
a metabolite linked to fried food consumption, was (negatively) associated with weight
loss, but a large number of baseline stool metagenomic features, including complex
polysaccharide and protein degradation genes, stress-response genes, respiration-related
genes, cell wall synthesis genes, and gut bacterial replication rates, were
significantly associated with weight loss after explicitly controlling for baseline BMI.
Together, these results provide a set of baseline gut microbiome functional features
that are associated with weight loss outcomes.
