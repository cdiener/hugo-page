title = "Bifidobacterium infantis supplementation versus placebo in early life to improve immunity in infants exposed to HIV: a protocol for a randomized trial"
+++

Infants who are born from mothers with HIV (infants who are HIV exposed but uninfected; iHEU) are at higher risk of morbidity and display multiple immune alterations compared to infants who are HIV-unexposed (iHU). Easily implementable strategies to improve immunity of iHEU, and possibly subsequent clinical health outcomes, are needed. iHEU have altered gut microbiome composition and bifidobacterial depletion, and relative abundance of Bifidobacterium infantis has been associated with immune ontogeny, including humoral and cellular vaccine responses. Therefore, we will assess microbiological and immunological phenotypes and clinical outcomes in a randomized, double-blinded trial of B. infantis RosellÂ®-33 versus placebo given during the first month of life in South African iHEU.
