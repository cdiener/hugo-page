Dietary intake is tightly coupled to gut microbiota composition, human metabolism, and
to the incidence of virtually all major chronic diseases. Dietary and nutrient intake
are usually quantified using dietary questionnaires, which tend to focus on broad food
categories, suffer from self-reporting biases, and require strong compliance from study
participants. Here, we present MEDI (Metagenomic Estimation of Dietary Intake): a method
for quantifying dietary intake using food-derived DNA in stool metagenomes. We show that
food items can be accurately detected in metagenomic shotgun sequencing data, even when
present at low abundances (>10 reads). Furthermore, we show how dietary intake, in terms
of DNA abundance from specific organisms, can be converted into a detailed metabolic
representation of nutrient intake. MEDI could identify the onset of solid food
consumption in infants and it accurately predicted food questionnaire responses in an
adult population. Additionally, we were able to identify specific dietary features
associated with metabolic syndrome in a large clinical cohort, providing a
proof-of-concept for detailed quantification of individual-specific dietary patterns
without the need for questionnaires.
