Cell penetrating peptides (CPP) and cationic antibacterial peptides (CAP) have
similar physicochemical properties and yet it is not understood how such similar
peptides display different activities. To address this question, we used Iztli
peptide 1 (IP-1) because it has both CPP and CAP activities. Combining
experimental and computational modeling of the internalization of IP-1, we show
it is not internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, yet it permeates into
many different cell types, including fungi and human cells. We also show that
IP-1 makes pores in the presence of high electrical potential at the membrane,
such as those found in bacteria and mitochondria. These results provide the
basis to understand the functional redundancy of CPPs and CAPs.
