We present QIIME 2, an open-source microbiome data science platform accessible
to users spanning the microbiome research ecosystem, from scientists and
engineers to clinicians and policy makers. QIIME 2 provides new features that
will drive the next generation of microbiome research. These include
interactive spatial and temporal analysis and visualization tools, support for
metabolomics and shotgun metagenomics analysis, and automated data provenance
tracking to ensure reproducible, transparent microbiome data science.
