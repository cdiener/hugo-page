Hi, my name is Christian and I am german-born scientist currently living in Seattle. My
primary areas of expertise are Data Science and Microbial Systems Biology, which means I am interested how
all of the microbes, cells and molecules around and within us interact in order to form stable ecological systems
and maintain you happy and healthy. In particular, I want to know what happens if those interactions are perturbed, for instance by
disease. I strongly believe that we can leverage medical, biological, ecoogical, and environmental data to help
us improve human health and to conserve our planet. However this will require an equitable, just, and diverse research community.

I love to learn new things and tinker and especially enjoy spending time with my partner and our pup. I also like to experiment and play around with different hard and software. I enjoy sharing what I have learned and have taught many courses in academia and tech. If I am not doing any of that you will usually find me eating, cooking or baking.

If you want to know what I am currently up to follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/@thaasophobia)
or see my projects on [github](https://github.com/cdiener).
