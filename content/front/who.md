Hi, my name is Christian and I am german-born scientist currently living in Mexico. My
primary areas of expertise are Data Science and Systems Biology, which means I am interested how
all of the cells, microbes and molecules in our bodies interact in order to maintain you happy and
healthy and what happens if those interactions are perturbed, for instance by
disease. I strongly believe that we can leverage medical and biological data to help
us improve human health. We just have to embrace the inherent complexity.

I am a classic nerd and love everything that has to do with technology,
particularly everything digital. As such I also like to play around different things. Apart from
that I love eating, cooking and baking.

If you want to know what I am currently up to follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/@thaasophobia)
or see my projects on [github](https://github.com/cdiener).
