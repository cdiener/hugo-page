Hi, my name is Christian and I am german-born scientist currently living in Seattle. My
primary areas of expertise are Data Science and Microbial Systems Biology, which means I am interested how
all of the microbes, cells and molecules around and within us interact in order to maintain you happy and
healthy. In particular, I want to know what happens if those interactions are perturbed, for instance by
disease. I strongly believe that we can leverage medical, biological and environmental data to help
us improve human health and to conserve our planet. We just have to embrace the inherent complexity.

I love everything that has to do with technology, particularly everything digital. As such I also like to experiment and play around with different hard and software. I enjoy sharing what I have learned and have taught many courses in academics or to tech professionals. If I am not doing any of that you will usually find me eating, cooking or baking.

If you want to know what I am currently up to follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/@thaasophobia)
or see my projects on [github](https://github.com/cdiener).
