As you might have already discovered from a quick look at the title of this page,
my name is Christian. I am german-born scientist currently living in Mexico. My
primary area of expertise is Systems Biology, which means I am interested how
all of the molecules in your body interact in order to maintain you happy and
healthy and what happens if those interactions are perturbed, for instance by
a disease. My mantra is to work clean and not predict things based on weak evidence.

I am a classic nerd and love everything that has to do with technology,
particularly everything digital. As such I also like to play around with programming
and data analysis. If you want to know what is going on in my head you can also
follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/@thaasophobia) or see my projects
on [github](https://github.com/cdiener).
