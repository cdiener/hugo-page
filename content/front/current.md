I am currently in my second postdoctoral fellowship here in Mexico at the [National Institute
of Genomic Medicine](http://inmegen.gob.mx) working on the Systems Biology of
Metabolism in human disease. This is done within the [Human Systems Biology Group]
(http://resendislab.inmegen.gob.mx) of Prof. Resendis-Antonio.

In the last year(s) I switched my focus to the microbiome in the human gut which means
I basically study the genetic material from the microbial communities that live within us.
I am working with several data sets that deal with the microbiota in diabetes and am trying
to identify the major changes in the microbiome during the transition from a healthy individual
to a diseased one. To that effect, I use various methods ranging from statistics to mathematical
modeling in order to understand how the microbiome affects the host
metabolism.

Before that I studied the metabolic alterations in cancer (you can find more about that
in my [publications](/pubs)).
