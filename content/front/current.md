I am currently in my second post-doc here in Mexico at the [National Institute
of Genomic Medicine](http://inmegen.gob.mx) working on the Systems Biology of
Metabolism in human disease. This is done within the [Human Systems Biology Group]
(http://resendislab.inmegen.gob.mx) of Prof. Resendis-Antonio.

Currently, we are interested in the metabolic alterations that occur during 
cancer. Even though have some idea of the metabolic liabilities of cancer in 
cell lines, that knowledge can usually not simply be transferred to cancer 
patients. We are trying to overcome this limitation by applying methods from 
machine learning and metabolic modeling to the the 
[NCI-60](https://dtp.cancer.gov/discovery_development/nci-60/) cancer cell line 
panel as well as the Cancer Genome Atlas 
([TCGA](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/)). This way we can study 
proliferation and metabolic fluxes in a personalized manner for the patients 
within the TCGA.
