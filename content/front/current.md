I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org)
and working in the field of Microbial Systems Ecology and Evolution. This is done within the [Gibbons Lab]
(http://gibbons.systemsbiology.org) under the leadership of Sean M. Gibbons.

In the last year(s) I switched my focus to the microbiome in the human gut which means
I basically study the genetic material from the microbial communities that live within us.
I am working with several data sets that study the microbial communities across thousands of individuals
to identify the major changes in the microbiome during the transition from a healthy state
to a diseased one. To that effect, I use various methods ranging from statistical inference to mathematical
modeling in order to understand how the microbiome affects the host metabolism. I am particularly interested in methods that go beyond mere correlations but also do some wet lab work in order to validate computational predictions.

Before that I studied signaling in microbial cultures and metabolic alterations in cancer (you can find more about that
in my [publications](/pubs)).
