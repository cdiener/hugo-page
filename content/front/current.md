I am currently in my second post-doc here in Mexico at the [National Institute
of Genomic Medicine](http://inmegen.gob.mx) working on the Systems Biology of
Metabolism in human disease. This is done within the [Human Systems Biology Group]
(http://resendislab.inmegen.gob.mx) of Prof. Resendis-Antonio.

Currently, we are interested in the metabolic alterations that occur during cancer.
Cancer is a very heterogeneous disease and even though many cancers look similar
on the outside, the alterations that lead to the cancer are not. We are working
on methods that can identify affected enzymes from global measurements of 
metabolite concentrations. We achieve that by a hybrid method from Systems Biology
and Bioinformatics that analyzes changes in the space of all possible enzyme 
activities for a distinct steady state.
