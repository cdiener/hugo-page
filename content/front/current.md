I am currently a Research Scientist at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://isbscience.org)
and working in the field of Microbial Systems Ecology and Evolution. This is done within the
[Gibbons Lab](http://gibbons.isbscience.org).

My work is focussed on the human gut microbiome which means
I basically study the genetic material, metabolism and ecology of microbial communities that live within us.
I am participating in or leading various projects that study the microbiota across thousands of individuals
to identify the major changes in the microbiome during the transition from a healthy state
to a diseased one. To that effect, I use various methods ranging from statistical inference to mathematical
modeling in order to understand how the microbiome affects the host metabolism. I am particularly interested
in methods that go beyond mere correlations and also do some wet lab work in order to validate computational predictions.

Before that I studied signaling in microbial cultures and metabolic alterations in cancer (you can find more about that
in my [publications](/pubs).
