I am currently in my second post-doc here in Mexico at the [National Institute
of Genomic Medicine](http://inmegen.gob.mx) working on the Systems Biology of
Metabolism in human disease. This is done within the [Human Systems Biology Group]
(http://resendislab.inmegen.gob.mx) of Prof. Resendis-Antonio.

This year is my year of the microbiome. I am working with several data sets
that deal with the microbiota in diabetes. We are currently combining classical
association studies with predictions from large community models (50+ species,
hundred thousands of biochemical reactions) to understand the metabolic
consequences of a particular microbial composition.
